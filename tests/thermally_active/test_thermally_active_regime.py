"""
For a cool shepard diagram and coranking matrix, use itertools.product([0, 1], repeat=dimension)
for every binary vector in a space of dimension dimension.
use BinaryListDatastream, FieldInputterBinary and FullOutputReader
use the "hamming" metric for both spaces
"""

"""
A problem:
You should absolutely repeat same points multiple times, because the ASI mapping is RANDOM! (yes also for NÃ©el)
BUT coranking matrix is not designed for non-unique points! meaning point p wil rank as 1 2 3 4 for itself if repeated 5 times,
but going to the mapping, it might go to 4 2 3 1 which is arbitrary and TOTALLY OKAY, but will hurt performance metrics!

Possible solution? Only look at K-ary neighbourhoods with K > #repeats ???
